# Data_Visualization_Challenge

In this challenge we are review the effectiveness of a drug regimen called Capomulin and seeing how it effects the tumor sizes on lab mice. We examine how the tumor sizes on the mice are effected over time and compare the results to other drug regimens.

From the data collected, there does appear to be a strong correlation (correlation of 0.84) between the weight of the mice and the average volume of the tumor they each had, where heavier mice displayed a larger tumor size. Based on that, I would recommend that the mice maintain healthy living conditions in order to yield the smallest tumor sizes.

The drug regimen Capomulin does appear to be an effective drug for treating cancer within the mice. That can be seen in the tumor volume for mouse l509 where the tumor size on the mouse decreased by a fair amount over the testing period.

The results for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin have shown to be fairly consistent based on the data collected. This can be seen in the box plots for each drug regimen where only one outlier was collected among the 4 drug regimens.
